# DESCRIPTION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUTPUT:
I have collected the basic information and gained the knowledge regarding to the task and the task is push-button-counter and I understand  about the importance of the arduino and purpose arduino and there are  different types of ardunios like arduino nano, arduino due and arduino micro and also the purpose of using different arduinos
And also understand the concept of using the push button counter in arduino and also known usage of the push button  counter 
And I  explored the use of digital Write and analog Write commands for controlling digital and analog outputs, respectively. And also analyze  how to manage output devices like LEDs and motors using Arduino programming.
Having the knowledge on push button switches, counters and LCD display made my task easy. Push button switches are used to switch ON or OFF, counters are used to count the no of times the button is pressed and finally LCD is used to display that how many times the button is pressed. In order to develop a embedded system we need to know about the code. Arduino IDE is the software platform used to write, compile the code and uploading to the hardware embedded board.
Finally, I had  gained the basic knowledge on embedded system and also analyzed the working of arudino and its operations and executed the push-button-counter
